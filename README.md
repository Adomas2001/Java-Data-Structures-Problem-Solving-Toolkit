# Java-Data-Structures-Problem-Solving-Toolkit

This repository contains implementations and applied problem-solving tasks using Java data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues) across diverse real-world-inspired scenarios. The project is split into foundational components and applied logic tasks, with emphasis on generic class usage, iterable structures, and file-based input/output handling.

## 📚 Project Overview

The project is structured into two major components:

### 1. **Lab Work 1A - Data Structures Implementation**
Includes the manual implementation and testing of the following:

- Generic `LinkedList<E>` with basic operations (add, remove, etc.)
- Interface `Stack<E>` with:
  - `ArrayStack<E>` (ArrayList-based)
  - `LinkedListStack<E>` (LinkedList-based)
- Interface `Queue<E>` with:
  - `ArrayQueue<E>` (ArrayList-based)
  - `LinkedListQueue<E>` (LinkedList-based)

Additionally, it includes three optional algorithmic tasks:
- Balanced parentheses checker (O(n) time)
- Moving average filter implementation (O(kn) complexity)
- Simulated print job processor with circular queue handling

### 2. **Lab Work 1B - Real-Life Task Solvers**
Each task reads input data from `.txt` files and processes it using the custom data structures. Examples include:

- 📘 **Task 1 - Teacher & Module Management**
- 🚌 **Task 2 - Bus Station Route Planner**
- 🗞️ **Task 3 - Publication Revenue Analysis**
- 💰 **Task 4 - Bonus Distribution System**
- 🏀 **Task 5/6 - Basketball Player Analysis**
- 🎓 **Task 7 - Student Scholarship Distributor**
- ☎️ **Task 8 - Phone Billing System**
- 🧾 **Task 9 - Utility Bill Analyzer**
- 🏨 **Task 10 - Hotel Booking Report**
- 🚕 **Task 11 - Taxi Fleet & Usage**
- 🛒 **Task 12 - Retail Product Tracker**
- 📮 **Task 13 - Stamp Collection System**
- ⚽ **Task 14 - Football Team Stats**
- 📂 **Task 15 - Project Work Selection**
- 🤖 **Task 16 - Online Device Store Analysis**

> All solutions use generic classes and custom singly linked list structures. Console output is organized in tabular format, with additional logging to `.txt` files for each result set.
